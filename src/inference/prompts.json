    "prompt": "Does Go language use Copy-on-write for strings as in Java? I.e. if I pass a string by value to a method and never change it will this allocate memory and copy the string (which will be time inefficient) or it will just reference a single copy.",
    "output": "It's not Copy-on-Write, as strings are immutable. But sharing a string will not make a copy of the underlying memory region either. In Go, a string is represented as a (length, data) pair. If you pass a string around, Go will copy the length and the pointer but not the data pointed to."
